# Stage Test
These codes demonstrate how to generate the setup files required to do a steady-state simulation on a turbine stage using GlennHT.
The starting point is a mesh called `StageMesh.xyz`. This is an example file that was generated by Tim Beach (NASA) using TGS (Turbo Grid System?)

# List of files and what they do

- **split_and_connectivity.py**: This file takes `StageMesh.xyz` and splits the blocks then finds the connectivity among the split blocks. Depending on how the blocks are defined, there may be some missed connectivity. For example where the o-mesh around the airfoil meets itself. That's an area where there maybe some in accuracies and connectivity is missed. For a face to match another face, there must be a point matching tolerance of 1E-6. 

The output of this file is a list of `outer_faces`, `periodic_faces`, and `matching_faces`.

- **connected_face_stator.py**: this file takes the `outer_faces` and determines if they are `inlet`, `outlet`, `mixing_plane`, or `stator_body`. The first step should be to plot the design using paraview `[path to paraview.exe] --script=pv_stator_plot.py`. 

Make sure you change the code inside pv_stator_plot to read the `stator_split_connectivity_periodicity.pickle`. Use the p
