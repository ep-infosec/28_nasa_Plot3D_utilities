    "# Introduction \n",
    "In aerospace, we use plot3D files to represent the fluid domain around a geometry. This allows us to perform simulations and calculate flow physics inside of each cell/rectangle. Often the connectivity of these blocks are not easily obtainable. You would have to buy an expensive tool that will create the mesh and output some kind of connectivity file. Sometimes these files are proprietary which doesn't help research. This `plot3d` library in python can be used to find connectivity information and also split the blocks into smaller blocks for evaluation. \n",

    "**The goal with this project is to enable research and learning. You shouldn't need to purchase something expensive to calculate all this for you.**"
