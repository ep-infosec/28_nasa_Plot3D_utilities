# Test case for axial duplication

To run the code first download the geometry and paste it in the folder 
> wget https://nasa-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/plot3d_utilities/PahtCascade-ASCII.xyz

Then run `python cascade_test.py` This will create the necessary pickle files. 

To visualize this in paraview. Run `[path to paraview]/paraview.exe --script= block-paraview_plot.py` 

This test case was used to create https://github.com/nasa/Plot3D_utilities/blob/main/colab/Plot3D_AxialDuplication.ipynb
